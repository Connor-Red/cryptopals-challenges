This will be a repo of my workings and solutions to the cryptopals crypto challenges for 
cryptography. The problems can be found here: https://cryptopals.com/

I have always been interested in cryptography and through this challenge I would like to 
deepen my understanding and also have some fun solving problems. I do not expect to finish
the entire thing as some of the later parts are basically only solvable for those with
employable knowledge in the field. This is just for fun and I'll see how far I can make it.

Each question will be in its respective folder and commentary of the problem along with the
problem itself would be in a markdown document enclosed within. I will try to solve the 
problems using C as it is what I need most practice on currently.
